\# Buenos Aires Community Workshops — November 2025

\#\# Introduction

In November 2025, two major community workshops were held in Buenos Aires as part of the Cardano 2030 Vision and Strategy engagement process.

The first session took place on November 15 at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) during the Cardano Summit, bringing together ecosystem contributors, university students, educators, developers, researchers, and new community members to explore infrastructure readiness, adoption pathways, research priorities, and regional opportunities.

The second session, held on November 16 at the IO Office in Buenos Aires, gathered one of the largest and most diverse regional and international groups to date, with participation from across Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, as well as contributors from Mexico, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and members of Intersect leadership.

This report consolidates the insights from both workshops and reflects the collective regional and global perspective on Cardano’s long-term direction.

\#\# The Workshop — November 15 (University of Buenos Aires)

The November 15 session convened developers, builders, students, academics, and industry participants to discuss the foundational elements of the Cardano 2030 Vision, including infrastructure, research, adoption, real-world use cases, and local ecosystem development.

Discussions were facilitated through interactive group dynamics, strategic prompts, and thematic conversations.
